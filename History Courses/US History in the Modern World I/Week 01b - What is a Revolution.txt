# What is a Revolution?

### ðŸŽ¯ MINI LESSON OBJECTIVES
Students will understand:

- Different types of revolutionary change (political, economic, social, technological)
- What distinguishes revolution from other forms of change
- The scope of revolutions this course will examine


## ðŸ”„ DEFINING REVOLUTION
### What Makes Change "Revolutionary"?

- Scale: Affects entire societies, not just individuals or small groups
- Speed: Relatively rapid transformation, not gradual evolution
- Scope: Changes fundamental structures, not just surface features
- Permanence: Creates new systems that persist over time

### Types of Revolutionary Change:

- Political Revolution - Changes in government structure and authority
- Economic Revolution - Transformation of how wealth is produced and distributed
- Social Revolution - Changes in class relationships and social organization
- Technological Revolution - New technologies that reshape society

#### Key Question: "Can you have one type of revolution without the others?"

## Why Revolutions Happen
### Common Patterns:

- System stress - Existing institutions can't solve new problems
- Elite divisions - Ruling groups disagree on solutions
- Popular mobilization - Ordinary people organize for change
- Alternative vision - New ideas about how society should work

### Different Triggers:

- Economic crisis - Financial collapse, trade disruption, resource scarcity
- Military defeat - War losses discrediting existing leadership
- Ideological challenge - New ideas undermining old legitimacy
- Environmental pressure - Climate change, disease, demographic shifts

## Revolutionary Outcomes:

- Success - New system replaces old one
- Failure - Old system survives and adapts
- Partial change - Some transformation but not complete revolution

## Revolutions in Our Course
### Political Revolutions We'll Study:

### "How do these different types of revolution connect to each other? Do political revolutions cause economic ones, or vice versa?"

## ðŸŽ­ CONNECTING TO COURSE THEMES
### Why This Matters:

- Contingency - Revolutions could have failed or succeeded differently
- Comparison - Different societies experienced different types of revolutionary change
- Causation - Understanding what drives fundamental historical transformation
- Global patterns - How revolutionary ideas and changes spread between societies.

# 20th Century World History: Power, Progress, and Global Transformation

## Course Overview

This 8-week, 16-session course develops critical thinking skills through investigation of five interconnected themes that shaped the 20th century: imperialism, scientific progress, ideological conflict, decolonization, and supranational institutions. Designed for BC Grade 11-12 students, the course prioritizes historical thinking competencies over content coverage, using primary sources and inquiry-based learning to connect past events to contemporary global challenges.

**Course Duration:** 8 weeks (16 sessions × 90 minutes)  
**Target Students:** BC Grade 11-12 Social Studies  
**Curriculum Alignment:** BC Social Studies curricular competencies and Historical Thinking Project framework

## Fundamental Course Questions

These overarching questions drive all learning and assessment:

1. **How did competing visions of power, progress, and governance reshape global relationships in the 20th century?**
2. **What were the intended and unintended consequences of attempts to create international order and cooperation?**
3. **How did technological and scientific changes interact with political and social movements to transform societies?**
4. **Why did some communities succeed in achieving self-determination while others struggled with ongoing conflicts?**

## Core Narrative Threads

### Thread 1: Imperial Crisis and Global Restructuring (1914-1991)
How imperial competition created conditions for global conflict, leading to new forms of international organization and decolonization movements that reshaped global power structures.

### Thread 2: Scientific Revolution and Social Transformation (1900-2000)
How rapid technological advancement served as both a tool of imperial control and liberation, driving ideological competition while creating new possibilities for human cooperation and conflict.

### Thread 3: Competing Modernities (1917-1991)
How different ideological systems offered alternative visions of political, economic, and social organization, with global consequences that continue to influence contemporary international relations.

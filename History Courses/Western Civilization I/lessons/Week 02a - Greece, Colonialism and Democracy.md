## **üìç LESSON OVERVIEW**

**üéØ Learning Objectives:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

- Analyze how the Bronze Age collapse transformed Greek civilization
- Explain how geographic factors influenced the development of the polis system
- Compare different Greek approaches to governance and citizenship
- Evaluate the relationship between external conflict and internal political development

**‚è∞ Duration**: 100 minutes **üìö Key Concept**: Creative response to geographic and historical constraints

## **üîó CONNECTING TO COURSE NARRATIVE**

**Previous Connection**: _Egypt showed how geographic advantages could create stable, centralized government lasting millennia_

**This Lesson's Role**: _Greece demonstrates how different geographic constraints and historical experiences can drive political innovation and competitive achievement_

**Looking Forward**: _Greek innovations in citizenship and governance will influence both Phoenician commercial republics and Roman constitutional development_

## **üìù LESSON STRUCTURE**

**üéØ Activity**: "The Greek Paradox"

**Central Question**: How did a collection of small, often warring city-states that never unified create innovations that still shape our world today?

**Materials**: Map showing hundreds of Greek poleis vs. unified Egyptian kingdom

**Discussion Prompt**: Compare the size and unity of Egypt with the fragmentation of Greece. Which approach seems more likely to create lasting achievements? Why might your initial assumption be wrong?

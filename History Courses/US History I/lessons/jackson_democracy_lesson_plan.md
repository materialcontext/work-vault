## ⏰ **LESSON STRUCTURE**

### **Opening Hook & Transition (8 minutes)**

**Bridge from Previous Lesson (2 minutes):**
"Yesterday we saw how the Missouri Crisis revealed deep sectional divisions that even compromise couldn't really solve. Today we'll see how Andrew Jackson promised a new kind of democracy to heal the nation - but did his approach actually strengthen or threaten democratic principles?"

**Dramatic Visual Opening (3 minutes):**
Display two contrasting images side by side:
1. Formal portrait of John Quincy Adams (elegant, aristocratic)
2. "Old Hickory" campaign poster of Jackson (rugged, common man appeal)

Ask: "What do these images tell you about what kind of leaders these men claimed to be? Which one looks more 'democratic' to you?"

**1828 Election Context (3 minutes):**
- **Adams:** Harvard educated, president's son, intellectual, formal
- **Jackson:** Self-made man, war hero, "Old Hickory," frontier background
- **New Democracy:** Property requirements for voting largely eliminated in most states
- **Campaign:** First truly national campaign with mass rallies, songs, slogans

"The 1828 election was unlike anything America had seen before - it became a battle over what democracy itself should look like."

### **Direct Instruction - The Democratic Revolution (14 minutes)**

**The Election of 1828: Democracy Expands (5 minutes)**

**New Democratic Features:**
- **Voter Turnout:** 1824: 27% → 1828: 58% of eligible men vote
- **Campaign Style:** Mass rallies, parades, barbecues, songs
- **Appeal to "Common Man":** Jackson as log cabin candidate vs. Adams as aristocrat
- **Party Organization:** Modern campaign tactics, party newspapers

**But Who Was Included?**
- **Expanded:** White men without property could now vote in most states
- **Still Excluded:** Women, most free Black men, Native Americans, enslaved people
- **The Paradox:** More democratic for some, more exclusionary for others

*1:1 Advantage:* Immediate discussion of this paradox - expanding and restricting democracy simultaneously

**Jackson's Presidential Style: The Spoils System (4 minutes)**

**"To the victor belong the spoils"**
- Jackson fires federal employees and replaces them with supporters
- **Reasoning:** Democracy means rotation in office, not permanent bureaucracy
- **Critics:** This is corruption, rewarding political friends
- **Supporters:** This breaks up elite control of government

**Specific Examples:**
- Postmasters, customs collectors, federal clerks replaced
- Party loyalty becomes job requirement
- Government positions become rewards for campaign work

**Student Analysis Question:** "Is this more democratic (ordinary people get government jobs) or less democratic (jobs based on politics, not qualifications)?"

**The Bank War: Presidential Power vs. Economic Elite (5 minutes)**

**Background:**
- Second Bank of the United States (BUS) chartered 1816, expires 1836
- Nicholas Biddle runs bank, seen as ally of wealthy merchants
- Jackson sees bank as privileged monopoly helping rich at expense of common people

**The Conflict:**
- 1832: Congress passes early recharter of bank
- Jackson vetoes it with dramatic message to Congress
- Becomes major issue in 1832 election
- Jackson wins, claims mandate to destroy bank
- Removes federal deposits from bank (1833)

**The Constitutional Crisis:**
- Jackson acts without Congressional approval for deposit removal
- Critics call him "King Andrew" for exceeding presidential power
- Jackson claims to represent "the people" directly

*1:1 Advantage:* Can explore both sides of this debate immediately, clarify complex constitutional issues

### **Guided Practice - Primary Source Analysis (16 minutes)**

**Document Introduction (3 minutes):**
"Jackson's Bank Veto Message became one of the most famous presidential documents of the 19th century. Let's see how he justified destroying the bank - and whether his arguments were democratic or dictatorial."

**Primary Source: Jackson's Bank Veto Message, July 10, 1832**

**Key Excerpts for Analysis:**

> *"The rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their selfish purposes... when the laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of society—the farmers, mechanics, and laborers—who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to complain of the injustice of their Government."*

> *"Many of our rich men have not been content with equal protection and equal benefits, but have besought us to make them richer by act of Congress... If we can not at once, in justice to interests vested under improvident legislation, make our Government what it ought to be, we can at least take a stand against all new grants of monopolies and exclusive privileges, against any prostitution of our Government to the advancement of the few at the expense of the many."*

> *"I have had men watching me who were watching the bank, and I tell you that you may as well hunt rabbits with dead puppies as to try to make a national bank with Nicholas Biddle at the head of it. The bank is trying to kill me, but I will kill the bank."*

**Guided Analysis Questions (8 minutes):**

**Message and Audience Analysis:**
1. **Who is Jackson's intended audience?** ("humble members of society," "farmers, mechanics, and laborers")
2. **How does Jackson portray himself?** (Defender of common people against rich elites)
3. **How does Jackson portray the bank?** (Tool of "rich and powerful," creating "artificial distinctions")

**Democratic Arguments:**
4. **What democratic principles does Jackson claim to defend?** (Equal protection, no special privileges, government for many not few)
5. **How does Jackson justify his veto power?** (Representing the people against corrupt Congress)

**Power and Tone Analysis:**
6. **What does the "hunt rabbits with dead puppies" quote reveal about Jackson's leadership style?** (Personal, combative, sees politics as warfare)
7. **Does Jackson sound like someone respecting other branches of government?** (No - very confrontational toward Congress and bank)

**Critical Thinking Questions (5 minutes):**
- **Is Jackson's argument democratic?** (Appeals to majority, attacks privilege)
- **Is Jackson's tone democratic?** (Authoritarian, personal, threatening)
- **Can you expand democracy and threaten democratic institutions at the same time?** (Key paradox of Jacksonian democracy)

*1:1 Advantage:* Deep exploration of this paradox, immediate feedback on complex political concepts

### **Independent Practice - Political Cartoon Creation (8 minutes)**

**Activity Introduction (2 minutes):**
"Political cartoons were hugely popular in Jackson's era. They're perfect for showing how the same person can be seen as a democratic hero or an authoritarian threat. You're going to create a cartoon showing either view."

**Cartoon Analysis Warm-up (2 minutes):**
Show famous "King Andrew" cartoon (Jackson in royal robes and crown)
- **Ask:** "What point is this cartoon making about Jackson?"
- **Techniques:** Crown and robes (symbol), stepping on Constitution (symbolism), "tyranny" label

**Cartoon Creation Task (4 minutes):**
**Choose Your Perspective:**

**Option A: Pro-Jackson Cartoon**
- Show Jackson defending common people against bank/wealthy elites
- Possible symbols: Jackson as shield protecting farmers/workers, bank as monster
- Caption ideas: "The People's Champion," "Down with Monopoly"

**Option B: Anti-Jackson Cartoon**
- Show Jackson as power-hungry dictator
- Possible symbols: Jackson as king, crown, breaking laws/Constitution
- Caption ideas: "King Andrew," "Where will it end?"

**Requirements:**
- Clear position (pro or anti Jackson)
- At least 2 symbols that 1830s Americans would understand
- Caption that explains your viewpoint
- Visual that connects to Bank War or spoils system

*1:1 Advantage:* Immediate feedback on cartoon concept, help with historical accuracy of symbols

### **Closure & Assessment (4 minutes)**

**Cartoon Sharing & Discussion (2 minutes):**
Student presents their cartoon and explains:
- Which perspective they chose and why
- What symbols they used and what they represent
- How their cartoon answers the focus question

**Synthesis Discussion (1 minute):**
"Based on Jackson's Bank Veto and what we've learned today, how would you answer our focus question: Did Andrew Jackson expand or threaten democratic principles?"

**Expected Elements in Response:**
- Recognition that Jackson did both simultaneously
- Evidence from the veto message about appealing to common people
- Evidence about concentration of presidential power
- Understanding that democracy can be expanded for some while excluding others

**Exit Ticket (1 minute):**
"Complete this sentence: 'Andrew Jackson was democratic because _______, but undemocratic because _______.' Use specific evidence."

**Preview Next Session:**
"Tomorrow we'll see the darkest side of Jackson's democracy - what happened when his vision of democracy for 'the common man' led to the forced removal of Native American nations. How did democracy for some become oppression for others?"

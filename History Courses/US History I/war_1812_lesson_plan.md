## ‚è∞ **LESSON STRUCTURE**

### **Opening Hook (8 minutes)**

**Anticipatory Set:**
"Imagine you're 13 years old in 1814, and enemy soldiers are marching toward your hometown, planning to burn down the most important buildings. Your family has to grab what they can and run. This actually happened to the President's wife in 1814. Let's see what she thought about it."

**Warm-up Activity:**
- Display map showing British approach to Washington DC, August 1814
- Ask: "What does it say about a country's strength if foreign enemies can march to its capital and burn government buildings?"
- Student initial response (2-3 minutes of discussion)

**Lesson Preview:**
"Today we're investigating whether the War of 1812 made America stronger or exposed serious weaknesses. We'll analyze a dramatic firsthand account and use evidence to support our own historical argument."

### **Direct Instruction (12 minutes)**

**Context Building:**
1. **Quick Review of Causes (4 minutes)**
   - Impressment of American sailors
   - British interference with American trade
   - British support for Native American resistance in the West
   - War Hawks pushing for war in Congress

   *1:1 Advantage:* Use interactive questioning: "Which of these causes do you think was most important? Why?"

2. **Key Events Timeline (4 minutes)**
   - War declaration June 1812
   - Early defeats: Detroit, failed Canada invasions
   - Naval victories: USS Constitution, Lake Erie
   - British retaliation 1814: burning of Washington
   - Battle of New Orleans January 1815

3. **Setting the Scene - August 24, 1814 (4 minutes)**
   - British forces approaching Washington DC
   - Government officials fleeing the capital
   - Dolley Madison's decision to save George Washington's portrait
   - Significance of capital city being attacked

### **Guided Practice - Primary Source Analysis (15 minutes)**

**Document Introduction (3 minutes):**
Present excerpted letter from Dolley Madison to her sister Anna Cutts, August 24, 1814:

> *"My dear Sister ‚Äì My husband left me yesterday morning to join General Winder. He inquired anxiously whether I had courage or firmness to remain in the President's house until his return... and on my assurance that I had no fear but for him, and the success of our army, he left, beseeching me to take care of myself, and of the cabinet papers, public and private... Tuesday Aug. 23rd ‚Äì Two messengers, covered with dust, come to bid me fly; but here I mean to wait for him... Wednesday morning, twelve o'clock ‚Äì Since sunrise I have been turning my spy-glass in every direction, and watching with unwearied anxiety, hoping to discover the approach of my dear husband and his friends; but, alas! I can descry only groups of military, wandering in all directions, as if there was a lack of arms, or of spirit to fight for their own fireside... Will you believe it, my sister? We have had a battle, or skirmish, near Bladensburg, and here I am still, within sound of the cannon! Mr. Madison comes not. May God protect us! Two messengers, covered with dust, come to bid me fly; but here I mean to wait for him... Three o'clock ‚Äì Will you believe it, my sister? We have had a battle, or skirmish, near Bladensburg, and here I am still, within sound of the cannon! Mr. Madison comes not. May God protect us! Two messengers, covered with dust, come to bid me fly; but I wait for him..."*

**SOAPS Analysis (8 minutes):**
Work through document systematically:

- **Speaker:** Who wrote this? (Dolley Madison, First Lady)
- **Occasion:** What's happening? (British attack on Washington, August 24, 1814)
- **Audience:** Who is she writing to? (Her sister Anna - personal, private letter)
- **Purpose:** Why is she writing? (To inform family, record events, express fears)
- **Subject:** What is she describing? (Chaos, fear, uncertainty, loyalty)

*1:1 Advantage:* Student can ask questions immediately, think aloud, make connections

**Evidence Gathering (4 minutes):**
Create T-chart: "Evidence of American Strength vs. Evidence of American Weakness"

From this document:
- **Strengths:** Dolley's courage, loyalty to husband/country, saving important artifacts
- **Weaknesses:** Military "wandering in all directions," "lack of arms or spirit," capital under attack, government fleeing

### **Independent Practice (10 minutes)**

**Historical Argument Construction:**
Student writes a paragraph responding to the focus question using evidence from:
1. The primary source
2. Background knowledge from the lesson
3. Connection to broader themes

**Sentence Starters Provided:**
- "Based on Dolley Madison's letter, the War of 1812 revealed..."
- "This evidence suggests that America in 1814 was..."
- "However, one could also argue that..."
- "Overall, I believe the war..."

*1:1 Advantage:* Immediate feedback on writing, ability to conference during writing process

### **Closure & Assessment (5 minutes)**

**Synthesis Discussion:**
- "How does Dolley Madison's experience connect to our bigger question about whether this war proved American independence?"
- "What would you want to know next to better answer our focus question?"

**Exit Ticket (2 minutes):**
"Quick write: If you could ask Dolley Madison one question about this experience, what would it be and why?"

**Preview Next Session:**
"Tomorrow we'll see how leaders like Henry Clay tried to use economic policies to strengthen the nation after the war - but did their 'American System' actually unite the country or create new divisions?"

## üéØ **DIFFERENTIATION FOR 1:1 INSTRUCTION**

**For Advanced Learners:**
- Compare Dolley Madison's account with British accounts of the same event
- Analyze why this personal letter might be more or less reliable than official government records
- Connect to modern examples of capitals under attack

**For Struggling Learners:**
- Pre-teach vocabulary: skirmish, cabinet papers, spy-glass, fireside
- Provide additional background on the Madison family and White House
- Use more guided questions during document analysis

**For English Language Learners:**
- Clarify archaic language and sentence structure
- Provide synonyms for difficult terms
- Use visual aids to support comprehension

---

## üìä **ASSESSMENT STRATEGIES**

**Formative Assessment:**
- Observation during discussion and analysis
- Quality of questions asked during document analysis
- T-chart evidence gathering accuracy
- Participation in synthesis discussion

**Summative Assessment:**
- Historical argument paragraph (scored on use of evidence, historical reasoning, writing clarity)
- Exit ticket responses showing engagement with essential question

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Can student identify multiple pieces of evidence from primary source?
- Does student understand the historical context of the document?
- Can student construct an argument using historical evidence?
- Does student connect specific events to broader historical themes?

## üîó **CONNECTIONS & EXTENSIONS**

**Connection to Unit Theme:**
This lesson builds toward understanding how early challenges tested American systems and identity, leading to next session's exploration of how leaders tried to strengthen the nation through economic policy.

**Modern Connections:**
- How do modern leaders respond during national crises?
- What does it mean for a country's capital to be attacked?
- How do personal accounts differ from official government statements?

**Potential Extensions:**
- Research other First Ladies during wartime
- Compare War of 1812 to other "second wars for independence" in world history
- Investigate what happened to the White House artifacts Dolley Madison saved

## üè† **HOMEWORK/PREPARATION FOR NEXT SESSION**

**Reflection Question:** "Based on what we've learned so far, what do you think the young United States needed most after the War of 1812 - military strength, economic development, or political unity? Be ready to explain your thinking."

**Material Prep:** Bring notebook for continuing our unit portfolio on "Building the American System"

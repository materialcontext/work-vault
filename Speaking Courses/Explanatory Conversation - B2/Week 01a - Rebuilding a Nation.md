## Lesson Structure

### Opening/Warm-up (8 minutes)

**Activity: Photo Analysis Hook**

1. **Visual Engagement** (3 min)
    
    - Present 2-3 striking photos: destroyed Southern cities, freed slaves, returning soldiers
    - Student describes what they see using present observations
    - Teacher models: "I notice..." / "This suggests..."
2. **Prediction Discussion** (5 min)
    
    - Teacher: "Imagine your country just finished a terrible war. Half the country fought the other half. What problems would you face when the war ends?"
    - Student brainstorms challenges using simple present: "People need..." / "The government must..."
    - Introduce lesson focus: "Today we'll learn how America faced these exact problems in 1865."

### Vocabulary Pre-teaching (12 minutes)

**Activity: Word Family Building**

1. **Core Terms Introduction** (7 min)
    
    - Introduce 4 key words with visual/contextual support:
        - **Reconstruction** (re- + construction = building again)
        - **Abolition** (ending slavery completely)
        - **Amendment** (change to the Constitution)
        - **Ratification** (official approval)
2. **Word Family Extension** (5 min)
    
    - Build word families on concept map:
        - Construct → reconstruction, construction, destructive
        - Abolish → abolition, abolitionist
    - Student creates sentences using each word family
    - Teacher provides sentence frames: "After the war, _______ was necessary because..."

### Main Instruction (25 minutes)

**Activity 1: Timeline Creation with Complex Sentences** (12 min)

1. **Historical Context Building** (5 min)
    
    - Present simplified timeline framework: 1861-1877
    - Mark key dates: 1865 (war ends), 1865 (Lincoln assassinated), 1865-1877 (Reconstruction period)
    - Model past perfect: "By the time the war had ended, over 600,000 Americans had died."
2. **Guided Timeline Completion** (7 min)
    
    - Student adds events using target grammar structures
    - Teacher provides sentence frames:
        - "After Lincoln had been assassinated, Johnson became..."
        - "Before Congress could implement its plan, the South had already..."
    - Focus on sequencing with time markers: after, before, by the time, when

**Activity 2: Reconstruction Plans Analysis** (13 min)

1. **Three-Plan Comparison** (8 min)
    
    - Introduce Lincoln's "10% Plan," Johnson's approach, and Radical Republican plan
    - Use graphic organizer with guided questions:
        - "How lenient was each plan?" (introduce 'lenient' vs. 'strict')
        - "What did each plan require from the South?"
    - Practice comparative language: "Lincoln's plan was more lenient than..." / "In contrast, the Radical Republicans wanted..."
2. **Primary Source Analysis** (5 min)
    
    - Read adapted excerpt from Lincoln's Second Inaugural: "With malice toward none, with charity for all..."
    - Discuss meaning using academic language frames:
        - "Lincoln believed that..."
        - "This suggests that his approach would be..."
    - Connect to reconstruction plans using dependent clauses

### Guided Practice (10 minutes)

**Activity: Academic Discussion with Sentence Frames**

1. **Structured Discussion** (7 min)
    
    - Teacher poses analytical questions using academic language:
        - "Why do you think different leaders had different reconstruction plans?"
        - "What challenges would make reconstruction difficult?"
    - Student responds using provided sentence frames:
        - "I believe that... because..."
        - "One challenge would be... since..."
        - "If I had been a leader then, I would have... because..."
2. **Vocabulary Integration** (3 min)
    
    - Challenge student to use all 4 target vocabulary words in their responses
    - Teacher provides immediate feedback on grammar and vocabulary usage
    - Model correct usage when needed: "You said 'Lincoln wanted to rebuild.' Can you use our word 'reconstruction' instead?"

### Assessment/Checking Understanding (3 minutes)

**Quick Formative Assessment**

- Student completes 3 sentence stems orally:
    1. "After the Civil War had ended, the biggest challenge was..."
    2. "Lincoln's reconstruction plan differed from the Radical Republicans' because..."
    3. "The process of ratification was important because..."
- Teacher notes accuracy of grammar structures and vocabulary usage

### Closure/Wrap-up (2 minutes)

**Preview and Reflection**

- Student summarizes lesson using one complex sentence with past perfect
- Preview next lesson: "Next class, we'll explore what actually happened when these reconstruction plans were put into action, focusing on the constitutional amendments."
- Exit ticket: "Write one question you have about reconstruction using our vocabulary words."

## Scaffolding Strategies

### For Grammar (Past Perfect vs. Simple Past)

- Provide timeline visual reference
- Use different colors for different time periods
- Give sentence frames with time markers
- Model think-aloud: "I need past perfect here because this happened before the other event"

### For Vocabulary

- Visual associations and word families
- Contextual examples from multiple time periods
- Progressive use from recognition to production
- Regular recycling in different contexts

### For Academic Discussion

- Sentence frames posted and available
- Think time before responding
- Teacher modeling of academic register
- Immediate positive feedback for attempts

---

## Differentiation Notes

- **If student struggles with past perfect:** Focus on timeline placement and use visual cues
- **If student needs challenge:** Add more complex dependent clauses and advanced vocabulary (unprecedented, tumultuous, contentious)
- **Cultural connections:** Draw parallels to reconstruction after conflicts in student's background knowledge

---

## Homework/Extension

- Write 4 sentences about the lesson using each vocabulary word
- Each sentence must include a time marker and appropriate past tense
- Example frame: "After the war had devastated the South, reconstruction became necessary to..."

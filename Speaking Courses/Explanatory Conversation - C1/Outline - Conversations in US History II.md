## Assessment Strategy: Cross-Domain Explanatory Fluency Rubric

### Fluency Indicators (Primary Focus):
- **Sustained Speech:** Can explain complex concepts for 3-5 minutes without excessive pauses
- **Coherence:** Ideas follow logically with clear connections between concepts
- **Clarity:** Explanations are comprehensible to someone unfamiliar with the topic
- **Confidence:** Speaks with assurance across both domains, self-corrects naturally

### Academic Language Use (Secondary Focus):
- **Domain-Specific Vocabulary:** Uses appropriate terminology for both science and history
- **Cross-Domain Functions:** Employs explanation language effectively in both contexts
- **Complexity:** Uses complex sentence structures to express nuanced ideas
- **Register:** Maintains academic tone appropriate for both scientific and historical discourse

### Content Understanding (Supporting Focus):
- **Accuracy:** Information is generally correct in both domains
- **Depth:** Shows understanding beyond surface-level facts
- **Analysis:** Can discuss systems, processes, and interactions in both areas
- **Transfer:** Applies explanatory skills effectively across different content areas

## Scaffolding Techniques for Dual-Domain Explanatory Fluency

### Universal Sentence Frames for Both Domains:
- **Process:** "This system/event works by... first... then... finally..."
- **Causation:** "This happens because... which leads to... resulting in..."
- **Analysis:** "The main factors/components are... the most important being..."
- **Comparison:** "In science/history, this is similar to... but different because..."

### Domain-Specific Language Supports:

**Science Explanations:**
- "When [condition], then [result] because..."
- "This property/characteristic means that..."
- "The relationship between X and Y is..."

**History Explanations:**
- "This decision/event was significant because..."
- "The consequences included both..."
- "Different groups were affected by..."

### Visual Supports:
- Process flowcharts for both scientific processes and historical events
- System diagrams for both physical systems and governmental systems
- Cause-and-effect maps for both scientific phenomena and historical events
- Comparison charts highlighting similarities in explanatory language across domains

### Confidence Building Across Domains:
- Explicit connection-making between similar explanatory tasks
- Practice transferring explanation skills from familiar to new content
- Recognition that strong explanation skills work in any academic subject
- Celebration of cross-domain explanatory successes

# Essential Vocabulary for Evidence

| **Term** | **Definition** | **Usage** |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Chemical Change** | Creates new substances with different properties | "This is a chemical change because..." |
| **Evidence** | Observable signs that prove something happened | "The evidence shows that..." |
| **Irreversible** | Cannot easily go back to original form | "This change is irreversible because..." |
| **Reaction** | When substances interact to form something new | "During this reaction..." |
| **Products** | New substances formed in chemical change | "The products have different properties..." |

::: notes
Focus on evidence language and scientific terminology for chemical processes.
:::

# Quick Review: Physical Changes

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="40%"}
### **What you know:**
- Keep same substance
- Change state only
- Usually reversible
- Energy adds/removes
::::

:::: {.column width="60%"}
### **Examples:**
- Ice melting → water
- Water boiling → steam  
- Paper tearing → smaller pieces
- Metal expanding → larger size
::::
:::

## **Test:** Can you get the original back easily? **Yes → Physical change**

::: notes
Solid foundation before introducing contrast. Reinforce reversibility concept.
:::

# Introducing Chemical Changes

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="40%"}
### **Key features:**
- Create new substances
- Different properties
- Usually irreversible
- Atoms rearrange
::::

:::: {.column width="60%"}
### **Examples:**
- Wood burning → ash + gases
- Iron rusting → iron oxide
- Food digesting → nutrients
- Baking cake → different texture/taste
::::
:::

## **Test:** Can you get the original back easily? **No → Chemical change**

::: notes
Direct contrast with physical changes. Emphasize irreversibility as key indicator.
:::

# Five Types of Evidence

| **Evidence Type** | **What You Observe** | **Example** |
|------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Color Change** | Substance becomes different color | Iron turns orange (rust) |
| **Gas Production** | Bubbles or smoke appear | Baking soda + vinegar fizzes |
| **Temperature Change** | Gets hot/cold without external heat | Hand warmers get hot |
| **Precipitate** | New solid forms in liquid | Milk curdles |
| **Light/Sound** | Glowing, sparking, loud reactions | Fireworks explode |

## **Remember:** Multiple types of evidence make your explanation stronger

::: notes
Concrete evidence types students can observe and describe. Emphasize multiple evidence.
:::

---

# Evidence Language Practice

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
### **Use these frames:**
- "You can tell a chemical reaction occurred because..."
- "The evidence includes..."
- "This indicates that..."
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
### **Practice example:**
Describe burning paper using evidence language
::::
:::

## **Goal:** Sound like a scientist when you explain what you observe

::: notes
Explicit instruction in evidence language. Practice with clear example.
:::

---

# Example 1: How Wood Burning Works

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="30%"}
### **Chemical Equation:**
Wood + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Ash + Energy
::::

:::: {.column width="70%"}
### **What Happens:**
Wood contains carbon and hydrogen. When heated, these react with oxygen from air. The original wood is completely destroyed and cannot be recovered.
::::
:::

### **Evidence You Observe:**
> - **Color change:** Brown wood → black/gray ash
> - **Gas production:** Smoke rises (CO₂ + water vapor)  
> - **Temperature change:** Fire produces heat and light
> - **New substances:** Ash has completely different properties

::: notes
Clear example with observable evidence. Students can relate to this common experience.
:::

---

# Example 2: How Iron Rusting Works

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="30%"}
### **Chemical Equation:**
Iron + Oxygen + Water → Iron oxide (rust)
::::

:::: {.column width="70%"}
### **What Happens:**
Iron atoms bond with oxygen atoms from air and water. This creates a completely new substance (rust) with different properties than original iron.
::::
:::

### **Evidence You Observe:**
> - **Color change:** Silver/gray iron → orange/brown rust
> - **Texture change:** Smooth metal → rough and flaky
> - **Strength change:** Strong iron → weak and crumbly
> - **Irreversible:** Cannot turn rust back into shiny iron easily

::: notes
Familiar example students see frequently. Emphasize property changes and irreversibility.
:::

---

# Example 3: How Food Digesting Works

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="30%"}
### **Chemical Process:**
Food + Digestive enzymes → Simple nutrients + Energy
::::

:::: {.column width="70%"}
### **What Happens:**
Complex food molecules (proteins, starches) are broken down into simpler molecules (amino acids, sugars) that your body can use.
::::
:::

### **Evidence Inside Your Body:**
> - **Chemical breakdown:** Large molecules → small molecules
> - **Energy release:** Your body gets energy from this process
> - **New substances:** Nutrients have different properties than original food
> - **Irreversible:** Cannot turn digested food back into original sandwich

::: notes
Connect to student's body processes. More abstract but relatable example.

# Teacher Demonstration Model

## **Baking Soda + Vinegar Explanation:**

> "Let me explain how we know this is a chemical change. First, I'm mixing baking soda with vinegar. Immediately, you can observe several types of evidence."

> "Bubbles form rapidly, which **indicates gas production**. The mixture becomes cooler, showing a **temperature change** without external heating."

> "Most importantly, we cannot separate this back into the original baking soda and vinegar - the substances have **reacted to form new products**."

> "All this evidence **proves** that a chemical reaction occurred."

::: notes
Model evidence-based explanation. Point out multiple evidence types and irreversibility conclusion.

# Compare and Contrast Practice

| **Aspect** | **Physical Change** | **Chemical Change** |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Substance** | Same substance, different state | New substances formed |
| **Reversibility** | Usually reversible | Usually irreversible |
| **Example** | Water freezing → ice | Wood burning → ash |
| **Evidence** | State change only | Multiple evidence types |
| **Molecular level** | Arrangement changes | Chemical bonds break/form |

## **Practice:** Explain why water freezing is physical but water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen is chemical

::: notes
Same starting material, different processes. Helps clarify the distinction.
